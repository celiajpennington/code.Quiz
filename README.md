#Timed Code Quiz

#Motivation

Demonstrate my newly aquired Javascript skills combined with my HTML & CSS knowledge by creating a timed quiz.

#Objective

User will start the quiz by clicking start button. That will start a timer in the upper righ side of the screen and will move the user to the first question. If the user answers the question incorrectly, time wioll be deducted from the timer and the user wiull be sent to the next question. If the answer is correct, the user will be sent to the next question. This should cycle through all question. Once the quiz is done, a quiz done page will show with the users score as well as a form for the user to submit their high score using their initials.
